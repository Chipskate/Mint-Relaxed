### ðŸ–¼ Description

Mint-Relaxed is a GTK theme for Linux Mint (Cinnamon edition), based on the official **Mint-Y-Dark-Aqua** theme. The goal was to create a more unified, clean, and modern look, while preserving Mint's usability and compatibility.

To complete the visual experience, it's highly recommended to use it together with the **Mint-Relaxed-Icons** icon set:

### ðŸŽ¨ About the Icons â€“ *Mint-Relaxed-Icons*

The Mint-Relaxed-Icons set was created to complement the Mint-Relaxed theme.
It is partially based on open source icon themes licensed under the GPL, such as:

* **Breeze** â€“ many icons were used as-is or modified
* **Numix-Circle** â€“ used occasionally for some application icons
* **Papirus** â€“ used in very small parts (e.g., one or two icons)
* **Hicolor** â€“ one or two icons included from this fallback theme

I drew inspiration from a Breeze-based icon theme created by an author named **l4k1**, who made a beautiful folder design to Breeze theme. Unfortunately, that theme was missing many icons for Cinnamon and GNOME-based desktops. Therefore, I:

* Redesigned many outdated icons to match the modern aesthetic
* Created many icons from scratch
* Carefully curated and unified the look to match the Cinnamon environment
